## Token

Earth Staked Ether (EARTH) is a decentralized liquid Ethereum staking token. In other words, the token supply is backed by the amount of Ethereum (ETH) being staked in the Earth Staking smart contracts. 

A conversion rate of 1 ETH to 369 EARTH is used to reduce the price per EARTH token, and tokens are minted and burned autonomously when a user deposits or withdraws their ETH to the Earth Staking contracts.

When ETH staking rewards are generated by the protocol, the total supply is *rebased*, meaning those who hold tokens recieve an increase in tokens proportional to the share of ETH they deposited into Earth Staking contracts. Similarly, if there is a staking penalty, the loss would be shared relative to each users holdings.

## Subgraph

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

## Developers

The easiest way to support our mission is to replace Earth Ether (EARTH) into your smart contract where you can, rather than ETH. This will enable liquidity to grow, and help passively generate more regeneration for the planet.
