## Token

Earth Staked Ether is a ERC20 token that represents ETH staked for EARTH. Total supply of EARTH reflects amount of ETH deposited into protocol combined with staking rewards, minus any validator penalties at a 1:369 ratio.

EARTH staking rewards automatically update to users balance every 7 days. Unlike normal staked eth, EARTH is liquid and can be transferred, traded, or used in DeFi applications, providing you a consistent stream of rewards with full functionality.
## Subgraph

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

## Developers

The easiest way to support our mission is to replace Earth Ether (EARTH) into your smart contract where you can, rather than ETH. This will enable liquidity to grow, and help passively generate more regeneration for the planet.
