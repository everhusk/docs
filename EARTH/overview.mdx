## Token

Social Network Governance Token is a ERC20 token that represents the amount of ETH staked for EARTH. Total supply of EARTH reflects amount of ETH deposited into protocol combined with staking rewards, minus any validator penalties at a 1:369 ratio.

Social Network Governance rewards automatically update to users balance every 7 days. Unlike normal staked eth, EARTH is liquid and can be transferred, traded, or used in DeFi applications, providing you a consistent stream of rewards with full functionality.
## Subgraph

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

## Developers

The easiest way to support our mission is to replace Social Network Governance (EARTH) into your smart contract where you can, rather than ETH. This will enable liquidity to grow, and help passively generate more regeneration for the planet.
