This launch will maximize protocol decentralization, and avoids the pitfalls or rugpull scenarios of having a single team or VC syndicate from controlling the network. By aligning incentives, we are hoping to ensure a healthy community who are in it
for the right reason, and acheive our mission of creating a truly politically-neutral, transparent, and real-time Economic, Social and Governance system for Earth.

## Developers

The easiest way to support our mission is to replace Social Network (EARTH) into your smart contract where you can, rather than ETH. This will enable liquidity to grow, and help passively generate more regeneration for the planet.
