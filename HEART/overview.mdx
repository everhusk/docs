## Contract

Earth Governance (HEART) is the governance token which is used to vote on upgrades, parameters, and improvements to Earth Staking, Earth Staking Token, and the Social Network.
No fundraise or presale was conducted, and it is 100% to the Earth Staking Controller upon creation. Distributions are then conducted as Taproot Farmers come online as follows:

This launch will maximize protocol decentralization, and avoids the pitfalls or rugpull scenarios of having a single team or VC syndicate from controlling the network. By aligning incentives, we are hoping to ensure a healthy community who are in it
for the right reason, and acheive our mission of creating a truly politically-neutral, transparent, and real-time Economic, Social and Governance system for Earth.
