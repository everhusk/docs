## How Earth Rewards Work:

Earth Rewards are designed to provide you with a seamless and rewarding experience.

These rewards include not only the standard staking rewards but also the additional benefits that come from activities like MEV (Miner Extractable Value) rewards. 

## How Pegged Tokens Work & EARTH Token

A pegged token maintains a stable value by anchoring itself to a trusted asset, such as USD, ETH, or BTC. The idea behind pegging is to provide stability and predictability to the token's value. 


In the case of EARTH being pegged to BTC, it means that the value of one EARTH token is designed to be equivalent to a certain amount of BTC. This is achieved by maintaining a specific reserve of BTC and by using smart contracts and algorithms to manage the supply of EARTH tokens in a way that keeps their value stable relative to BTC.
