Earth Staking is powered by 2 tokens. EARTH Token and HEART Token. To learn more about EARTH Token. 

## About HEART Tokens

HEART Rewards represents the heart of Earth's ecosystem, with a total supply of 777,777,777,777 tokens. These HEART tokens serve as the governance mechanism that powers our network, enabling active participation and contributions from our community.

## Earning HEART Tokens
There are several ways to earn HEART tokens within the Earth ecosystem:

1. **Staking Bitcoin:** Securely staking either Bitcoin or Ethereum makes you eligible for HEART Rewards. Our staking process is non-custodial and fully decentralized, ensuring security and trust in your participation. This is the primary way to engage with the protocol and earn HEART. 


2. **Running Earth Relays:** Running validators as a Node Operator also entitles you to HEART Rewards. Your dedication to securing the network is rewarded with HEART tokens.  


3. **Joining the Community:** Become part of our passionate community, engaging in discussions, joining our ambassador program, and many other community driven initiatives and events where you can earn HEART tokens for your contributions. Learn about community


4. **Social.Network & Nostr Content:** Contribute valuable content on our L2 Social.Network integrated with the Nostr protocol to earn HEART tokens. More information in Q2 2024 coming soon. 



## Layered Heart Unlocking
As we progress through the Earth’s Layers, new HEART tokens are unlocked to fuel our ecosystem’s growth. Every layer, from Inner Core, Outer Core, Mantle, and Crust, reveals a fresh allocation of HEART tokens. Upon the completion of one layer, the subsequent layer unlocks, making way for the distribution of new HEART tokens. This process extends to all participants within the Earth Ecosystem, encompassing Stakers, Relayers, and Community Members.

## Governance with Social.Network

HEART token distribution is orchestrated via the Social.Network DAO, guaranteeing an equitable and transparent allocation process. Scaling on-chain governance systems to a global social network scale is achieved through our layer 2 solution known as “social.network.” Our Sequencer - Layer 2 framework leverages the power of Optimism and its Zero-Knowledge Rollups, settling on Ethereum. Additionally, data availability is ensured through the Earth Relay Nostr Network, which minimizes data costs significantly. This seamless integration enables the scalability of voting mechanisms and data storage on our social network, marking a significant step towards a more efficient and inclusive governance model.

## HEART Tokenomics

HEART is the native token of the Earth Staking ecosystem, designed to power and govern the network.

**Total Supply:**

- The total supply of HEART tokens is fixed at 777,777,777,777 HEART Tokens.

**Token Distribution:**

- 33% of HEART tokens are allocated to Stakers.

- 33% of HEART tokens are allocated to Node Operators.

- 33% of HEART tokens are allocated to the Community.

**Unlocking Mechanism:**

The distribution of HEART tokens is tied to the total amount of Bitcoin staked in the Earth ecosystem. As specific thresholds of Bitcoin are staked, corresponding amounts of HEART tokens are unlocked. This distribution model promotes the growth and development of the Earth project.

- Genesis Layer: Approximately $5 Million in BTC

- Inner Core: Approximately $50 Million in BTC

- Outer Core: Approximately $500 Million in BTC

- Mantle: Approximately $5 Billion in BTC

- Crust: Approximately $50 Billion in BTC

### Staker Allocations:

Stakers have a total allocation of **33% of the Total HEART Supply**. Within the Stakers' allocation participants have the opportunity to earn various rewards, including DeFi Rewards, ReFi Rewards, and other Staker Rewards.

### Node Operator Allocations:
Node Operators have a total allocation of **33% of the Total HEART Supply**. Their allocation of HEART tokens varies based on the layer they operate in:

**Inner Core Node Operators:**
- Receive 8.33% of the Node Operators' allocation.
- Follow a 4-Year Vesting Schedule.
- Have a 1-Month Cliff.
- A total of 9 Node Operators are allocated in this layer.

**Outer Core Node Operators:**

- Follow a 3-Year Vesting Schedule.
- Have a 2-Month Cliff.
- A total of 90 Node Operators are allocated in this layer.

**Mantle Node Operators:**
- Receive 8.33% of the Node Operators' allocation.
- Follow a 2-Year Vesting Schedule.
- Have a 3-Month Cliff.
- A total of 900 Node Operators are allocated in this layer.

**Crust Node Operators:**
- Receive 8.33% of the Node Operators' allocation.
- Follow a 1-Year Vesting Schedule.
- Have a 4-Month Cliff.
- A total of 9000 Node Operators are allocated in this layer.

This tiered allocation structure ensures that Node Operators are fairly rewarded for their contributions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Earth network.

### Ecosystem Allocations:

Ecosystem has a total allocation of **33% of the Total HEART Supply**. Within the Ecosystem, three key pillars play a pivotal role in shaping the Earth project:
