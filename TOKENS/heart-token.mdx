## About HEART Tokens

HEART Rewards represents the heart of Earth's ecosystem, with a total supply of 777,777,777,777 tokens. These HEART tokens serve as the governance mechanism that powers our network, enabling active participation and contributions from our community.

## Earning HEART Tokens
There are several ways to earn HEART tokens within the Earth ecosystem:

1. **Staking Bitcoin:** Securely staking either Bitcoin or Ethereum makes you eligible for HEART Rewards. Our staking process is non-custodial and fully decentralized, ensuring security and trust in your participation. This is the primary way to engage with the protocol and earn HEART. 


2. **Running Earth Relays:** Running validators as a Node Operator also entitles you to HEART Rewards. Your dedication to securing the network is rewarded with HEART tokens.  


3. **Joining the Community:** Become part of our passionate community, engaging in discussions, joining our ambassador program, and many other community driven initiatives and events where you can earn HEART tokens for your contributions. Learn about community


4. **Social.Network & Nostr Content:** Contribute valuable content on our L2 Social.Network integrated with the Nostr protocol to earn HEART tokens. More information in Q2 2024 coming soon. 



## Layered Heart Unlocking
As we progress through the Earth’s Layers, new HEART tokens are unlocked to fuel our ecosystem’s growth. Every layer, from Inner Core, Outer Core, Mantle, and Crust, reveals a fresh allocation of HEART tokens. Upon the completion of one layer, the subsequent layer unlocks, making way for the distribution of new HEART tokens. This process extends to all participants within the Earth Ecosystem, encompassing Stakers, Relayers, and Community Members.

## Governance with Social.Network

HEART token distribution is orchestrated via the Social.Network DAO, guaranteeing an equitable and transparent allocation process. Scaling on-chain governance systems to a global social network scale is achieved through our layer 2 solution known as “social.network.” Our Sequencer - Layer 2 framework leverages the power of Optimism and its Zero-Knowledge Rollups, settling on Ethereum. Additionally, data availability is ensured through the Earth Relay Nostr Network, which minimizes data costs significantly. This seamless integration enables the scalability of voting mechanisms and data storage on our social network, marking a significant step towards a more efficient and inclusive governance model.

## ERC-20 Wallets
HEART Tokens are ERC-20 compliant, making them compatible with a wide range of Ethereum wallets, including but not limited to Earth Wallet and Metamask.

**Stay Tuned for Setup Instructions**

In the near future, we will provide detailed instructions on how to set up and utilize the HEART Token with Metamask, Earth Wallet and other ERC20 Wallets. Your journey with HEART Rewards begins here, as you contribute to Earth's sustainable and prosperous future while earning valuable incentives along the way.
