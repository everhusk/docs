## What is Bitcoin Staking?

Bitcoin Staking is a new way to create incentives for decentralized social networks, that can remain as a public good for all life on Earth, rather than competing with other platforms for power and control. The easiest way to participate,
in this new revolution, without the required technical knowledge of running nodes, is to simply stake Bitcoin to Social Network (HEART).

## Stake Bitcoin to the Social Network

1. Obtain Bitcoin (BTC) from the open market.

2. Use the [staking app](https://app.social.network/) and connect your wallet, or make a valid P2TR Bitcoin transaction to initiate a Bitcoin Staking request.

3. Earth Nodes will recieve the staking request after 6 Bitcoin block confirmations, and deposit 369 [HEART](/heart) to your wallet on the Social Network for every satoshi staked.

4. You will automatically begin generating rewards based on the current inflation rate of the Social Network. Every 7 days, the $HEART token is rebalanced according to the amount of staking rewards generated minus the protocol fees set by the EARTH governance. 
This ensures rewards are distributed to each stakeholders without ever giving Earth Nodes control of the funds, and users are able to unstake their HEART balance back to BTC at any time from their self custody wallets.

Your balance will increase every 7 days proportional to the amount of BTC you have staked, and how much the decentralized Earth node network earns over that period.

Real time analytics will be provided at [app.social.network/rewards](https://app.social.network/rewards), and will be the sum of the Earth Node validator network minus any fees or network penalties. Any regeneration initiatives
successfully initiated by Earth Wallet will be tracked in real time on the rewards dashboard, to give the community a live updates. [Learn more about HEART token](/heart).
