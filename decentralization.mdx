## Overview of Earth Staking Node Operators:

Earth Staking is made up of a decentralized network of Earth Nodes, who together, jointly secure the future of innovation on Bitcoin Taproot & Ethereum Staking for the first time ever. 
This decentralized network is the key to unlocking the potential of the $1T decentralized & regenerative markets on Bitcoin without the systemic risk of centralized exchanges, with significantly less energy, and trust.
Ensuring proper decentralization is critical to the stability and security of the entire purpose of Earth Staking and the blockchain industry.

Recognizing this significant, the network was fully bootstrapped, with no venture capital or other interests, and initial Taproot Farmer onboarding will be done via a referral system to 
open source and infrastructure providers to both Bitcoin Core and Ethereum Core over the past 7 years. This section will overview the mechanics of the referral system, and how it ensures
simplicity, and maximizes stability, security, and progressively decentralizes as the Taproot Farming network grows in size.

## Node Operation Structure:

The operation of nodes within Earth Staking follows a structured approach, similar to the structure governing Stakers and Community participants. There are five distinct layers, each with varying time commitments, allocations of operators, and different heart unlocking mechanisms. A total of 33% of the HEART supply is allocated to running Nodes.

1. **Genesis Layer:** Comprising 1 Node Operator with a 5-year commitment.
2. **Inner Core:** Featuring 9 Node Operators committed for 4 years, unlocking 8.33% of the total HEART supply.
3. **Outer Core:** Encompassing 90 Node Operators with a 3-year commitment, unlocking 8.33% of the total  HEART supply.
4. **Mantle:** Involving 900 Node Operators committed for 2 years, unlocking 8.33% of the total  HEART supply.
5. **Crust:** Incorporating 9000 Node Operators committed for 1 year, unlocking 8.33% of the total  HEART supply.

**Current Progress:**

Currently, we are in the process of the initial 9 Node Operators within the Inner Core. These operators are integral infrastructure entities with prior experience in running nodes, ensuring the stability and reliability of the network.

## How to Run a Node:
To become an official Earth Staking Node Operator, there are two primary requirements:

1. **Run a Bitcoin Node:** Detailed information on running a Bitcoin Node can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node).

2. **Run a Nostr Relay:** For instructions on running a Nostr Relay, please refer to [this link.](https://usenostr.org/relay)

This ensures the comprehensive security and robustness of the Earth Staking network, making it an excellent opportunity for those looking to actively contribute to our mission.
