## Earth Layers Overview 

EARTH Staking operates within a structured framework mirroring the Earth's geological layers, encompassing four distinctive tiers: Inner Core, Outer Core, Mantle, and Crust. These layers represent crucial milestones in the project's growth and evolution, each unlocking various benefits and features that contribute to the overall Earth Ecosystem.

## Earth Layers - Staking 
The primary driving force behind these layers is the amount of assets staked within them. At its inception, Earth Staking was exclusively focused on staking Bitcoin. As specific thresholds of Bitcoin are staked, corresponding amounts of EARTH Pegged Tokens are minted, marking the progression through Earth's layers:

Inner Core: Approximately 0.5 million in BTC

Outer Core: Approximately 5 million in BTC

Mantle: Approximately 50 million in BTC

Crust: Approximately 500 million in BTC

Reaching these milestones not only unlocks unique advantages but also signifies the growth and development of the Earth project.

## Earth Layers - Relayers 
The Relayer system, represented by Node Operators, follows a structured approach with an allocated number of Relayers per layer, each with a specific time commitment:

Inner Core: 9 Relayers (4-Year Commitment)

Outer Core: 90 Relayers (3-Year Commitment)

Mantle: 900 Relayers (2-Year Commitment)

Crust: 9000 Relayers (1-Year Commitment)

Within this tiered system, the time commitment for Relayers decreases as the Earth project progresses. In addition to the time commitment, the HEART Rewards allocated to each Relayer are determined by the layer and time commitment they are part of. This system is designed to align with Earth Staking's mission of promoting sustainable growth and fostering a secure infrastructure.

## Earth Layers - Community

The Earth's layered structure serves as a primary incentive mechanism for the Earth community to actively participate in its growth and development. This encompassing community includes various elements such as Bounty Programs, Ambassadors, Research and Development (R&D) initiatives, Campaigns, Grant Programs, the Social.Network DAO, and the entire expanding ecosystem. The unlocking of new HEART allocations correlates with the growth of these layers, providing a robust incentive framework to ensure that dedicated contributors are continuously engaged in advancing the Earth project.

This incentive mechanism is fundamentally aligned with our planet's well-being and improvement. It emphasizes the importance of collective effort and collaboration to enhance and progress Earth for the benefit of all. As the layers expand and evolve, more HEART tokens are unlocked, ushering in further advancements driven by the decentralized governance of the Social.Network DAO. This collaborative and incentivized approach is at the core of Earth Staking's mission to create positive change for our planet.
