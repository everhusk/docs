## Overview of Earth Staking Node Operators:

Node Operators are essential for Earth Staking, ensuring network security and contributing significantly to the projectâ€™s overall success.

## Node Operation Structure:

The operation of nodes within Earth Staking follows a structured approach, similar to the structure governing Stakers and Community participants. There are five distinct layers, each with varying time commitments, allocations of operators, and different heart unlocking mechanisms. A total of 33% of the HEART supply is allocated to running Nodes.

1. **Genesis Layer:** Comprising 1 Node Operator with a 5-year commitment.
2. **Inner Core:** Featuring 9 Node Operators committed for 4 years, unlocking 8.33% of the total HEART supply.
3. **Outer Core:** Encompassing 90 Node Operators with a 3-year commitment, unlocking 8.33% of the total  HEART supply.
4. **Mantle:** Involving 900 Node Operators committed for 2 years, unlocking 8.33% of the total  HEART supply.
5. **Crust:** Incorporating 9000 Node Operators committed for 1 year, unlocking 8.33% of the total  HEART supply.

**Current Progress:**

Currently, we are in the process of the initial 9 Node Operators within the Inner Core. These operators are integral infrastructure entities with prior experience in running nodes, ensuring the stability and reliability of the network.

## How to Run a Node:
To become an official Earth Staking Node Operator, there are two primary requirements:

1. **Run a Bitcoin Node:** Detailed information on running a Bitcoin Node can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node).

2. **Run a Nostr Relay:** For instructions on running a Nostr Relay, please refer to [this link.](https://usenostr.org/relay)
