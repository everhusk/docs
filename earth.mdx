## About EARTH Tokens

EARTH Rewards represents the governance token for the Earth ecosystem, with a total supply of 777,777,777,777 tokens. These EARTH tokens serve as the governance mechanism that powers our network, enabling active participation and contributions from our community.

## Earning EARTH Tokens
There are several ways to earn EARTH tokens within the Earth ecosystem:

1. **Staking Bitcoin:** Securely staking either Bitcoin or Ethereum makes you eligible for EARTH Rewards. Our staking process is non-custodial and fully decentralized, ensuring security and trust in your participation. This is the primary way to engage with the protocol and hold HEART. 


2. **Running Earth Nodes:** Running validators as a Node Operator also entitles you to EARTH Rewards. Your dedication to securing the network is rewarded with EARTH tokens.  


3. **Joining the Community:** Become part of our passionate community, engaging in discussions, joining our ambassador program, and many other community driven initiatives and events where you can earn EARTH tokens for your contributions. Learn about community


4. **Bitcoin Social Network Developers & Creators:** Contribute valuable content on the decentralized Social Network integrated with the Nostr protocol to earn EARTH tokens. More information in Q2 2024 coming soon. 

## Earth Layers Unlocking

As we progress through the Earth’s Layers, new EARTH tokens are unlocked to fuel our ecosystem’s growth. Every layer, from Inner Core, Outer Core, Mantle, and Crust, reveals a fresh allocation of EARTH tokens. Upon the completion of one layer, the subsequent layer unlocks, making way for the distribution of new EARTH tokens. This process extends to all participants within the Earth Ecosystem, encompassing Stakers, Relayers, and Community Members.

## Governance Contracts

EARTH token distribution will be orchestrated via the Social Network layer two, guaranteeing an equitable and transparent allocation process. Scaling on-chain governance systems to a global social network scale is achieved through our layer 2 solution known as the Bitcoin Social Network.” Our Sequencer - Layer 2 framework leverages the power of Optimism and its Zero-Knowledge Rollups, settling on Ethereum. Additionally, data availability is ensured through Earth Nodes, which minimizes data costs significantly. This seamless integration enables the scalability of voting mechanisms and data storage on our social network, marking a significant step towards a more efficient and inclusive governance model.

## EARTH Tokenomics

EARTH is the core token of the Earth Staking ecosystem, designed to power and govern the network.

**Total Supply:**

- The total supply of EARTH tokens is fixed at 777,777,777,777 EARTH Tokens.

**Token Distribution:**
