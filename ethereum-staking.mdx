## Earth Staking Token (EARTH)

Earth Staking is architected to be fully decentralized, our mission is to create a new global reserve currency leading to a peaceful planet for all life on Earth, rather than competing with other forms of life on Earth for individual gain. The easiest way to participate,
without the required technical knowledge and risk of running a Taproot Farm, is by staking ETH in the liquid staking protocol for EARTH.

### How to Stake for Earth

1. Obtain Earth Staking Token is a ETH liquid staking token, minted at a 1:369 ratio with ETH at [Earth Staking](https://app.earthstaking.com/) or via [Uniswap](https://uniswap.com).

2. Once 32 ETH is queued in the Earth Staking protocol it is automatically send to a Earth Node to begin generating Ethereum block rewards automatically sent back to the protocol. Every 7 days, the Earth Staked Ether token is rebalanced according to the amount of block rewards generated minus the protocol fees set by the ESG governance. 
This ensures rewards are distributed to each stakeholders without ever giving Earth Nodes control of the funds, and users are able to unstake their EARTH balance back to ETH at any time without ever giving up custody of their assets.

Earth Staking lets you keep stake from a cold wallet, and have your rewards paid out to a different wallet. Giving you the optimal security and user experience for all scenarios.

### Earn Ethereum Staking Rewards

Your Earth Staking balance will increase every 7 days proportional to the amount of ETH you have staked, and how much the decentralized Earth Node validator network earns over that period.
The current Ethereum staking rewards can be found [here](https://ethereum.com/en/staking/), and can be used as a rough estimate of how much the Earth Node validator network should be earning over time.

Real time analytics will be provided at [earthstaking.com/rewards](https://app.earthstaking.com/rewards), and will be the sum of the Earth Node validator network minus any fees or network penalties. Any regeneration initiatives
successfully initiated by Earth Wallet will be tracked in real time on the rewards dashboard, to give the community a live update on the status of our pollution cleanup mission. 

### Earn Additional DeFi Rewards (Limited)

Earth Staking offers the flexibility to delegate block rewards to a separate wallet, providing optimal security, potential tax benefits, and an enhanced user experience, especially when traveling. 
This feature empowers users to manage their assets and rewards in a manner that best suits their needs while maintaining the highest level of security and control. Deposit the desired amount of Ethereum into Earth Staking's decentralized liquid staking protocol to start earning block rewards. 

### Redeeming ETH Rewards

EARTH can be redeemed for ETH on the [Smart Contracts](https://etherscan.io), [Earth Staking](https://earthstaking.com/unstake), or [Uniswap](https://uniswap.com).

If enough liquidity is in the queue, the user can withdraw immediately, otherwise an Farmer exit signature is submitted to remove an Taproot from Ethereum validating and return the liquid deposit staked back to the queue. Validator withdrawals [(as of writing)](https://launchpad.ethereum.com/withdrawals) are dependant on the Ethereum network withdrawal queue and may vary, after which the funds should be available.
