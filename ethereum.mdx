## Introduction
Ethereum isn't just about tokens, monkey jpegs, or casino games. It's a beacon of innovation - decentralized, transparent, and fortressed against corruption. Think of it as a canvas, and on this canvas, we have the potential to paint solutions that monitor, verify, and reward efforts to cleanse our Earth. Imagine a world where no matter what happens on the Ethereum blockchain, the fundamental base layer helps rejuvenate our environment. With Earth Staking, Ethereum can become the heart of this new wave of building on digital future.

## Earth Staked Ether (EARTH)

The Earth Staking smart contracts are designed to be fully permissionless similar to RocketPool, with a fair launch of the governance token distributed to early node operators.
For those unfamiliar, liquid staking is the most commonly used method of helping secure transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, with a majority being staked to Lido. To join the Earth Staking protocol fair launch,
users can simply accumulate Earth Staked Ether or run Earth Staking Governance (ESG) Nodes. This page will overview the easier option of liquid staking.

### Get Started

1. Obtain Earth Staked Ether deposit/mint ETH for EARTH at a 1:369 ratio at [earthstaking.com/stake](https://earthstaking.com/stake) or [swap ETH for EARTH](https://uniswap.com).

2. Once 32 ETH is queued in the Earth Staking protocol it is automatically send to a Earth Node to begin generating Ethereum block rewards automatically sent back to the protocol. Every 7 days, the Earth Staking token is rebalanced according to the amount of block rewards generated minus the protocol fees set by the Earthean governance. 
This ensures rewards are distributed to each stakeholders without ever giving Earth Nodes control of the funds, and users are able to unstake their EARTH balance back to ETH by:

### Stake from your Wallet

Earth Staking was designed from scratch and audited in partnership with Halborn Security to optimize security. To get started, visit our staking app and connect a wallet of your choice (i.e. Earth Wallet).

Earth Staking lets you keep stake from a cold wallet, and have your rewards paid out to a different wallet. Giving you the optimal security and user experience for all scenarios.

### Earn Ethereum Staking Rewards

Your Earth Staking balance will increase every 7 days proportional to the amount of ETH you have staked, and how much the decentralized Earth Node validator network earns over that period.
The current Ethereum staking rewards can be found [here](https://ethereum.com/en/staking/), and can be used as a rough estimate of how much the Earth Node validator network should be earning over time.

Real time analytics will be provided at [earthstaking.com/rewards](https://app.earthstaking.com/rewards), and will be the sum of the Earth Node validator network minus any fees or network penalties. Any regeneration initiatives
successfully initiated by Earth Wallet will be tracked in real time on the rewards dashboard, to give the community a live update on the status of our pollution cleanup mission. 

### Delegate your Rewards

Earth Staking offers the flexibility to delegate block rewards to a separate wallet, providing optimal security, potential tax benefits, and an enhanced user experience, especially when traveling. 
This feature empowers users to manage their assets and rewards in a manner that best suits their needs while maintaining the highest level of security and control. Deposit the desired amount of Ethereum into Earth Staking's decentralized liquid staking protocol to start earning block rewards.

### Redeeming ETH Rewards

1. Withdraw/burn EARTH for ETH at a 369:1 ratio at [earthstaking.com/unstake](https://earthstaking.com/unstake) or [swap EARTH for ETH](https://uniswap.com).

2. If enough liquidity is in the queue, the user can withdraw immediately, otherwise an Earth Node exit signature is submitted to remove an Earth Node from Ethereum validating and return its 32 ETH stake back into the queue.

3. Validator withdrawals [(as of writing)](https://launchpad.ethereum.com/withdrawals) occur roughly every 9 days, after which the funds should be available.
