## Consensus

With over $100B in decentralized finance markets, Ethereum serves as the ideal base layer to bootstrap a new Earth centered economic system. However, to date, most attempts to build Regenerative Finance have fell short due to (a) lack of demand, and (b) lack of integrations. Earth Staking solves this by driving the demand from liquid staking, and easing the onboarding of a new class of users into the Ethereum ecosystem.

By leveraging Ethereum's decentralized, transparent, and secure infrastructure, innovative solutions for tracking, verifying, and incentivizing pollution reduction could be developed. 
This could stimulate a new wave of 'green' decentralized applications (dApps), fostering innovation and driving increased usage and adoption of the Ethereum network. Additionally, the use of Ethereum's smart contracts could enable the creation of new markets for carbon credits or other pollution-related tokens, providing new revenue streams for participants in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Earth Ether enables anyone with any amount of Ether (ETH) to participate in Ethereum staking, without advanced knowledge of how to operate staking nodes. requiring 32 ETH, or knowing how to avoid slashing penalties. This user experience, has led to the vast majority of Ethereum tokens to be staked on either central exchanges, or centralized node operators (Lido). The liquid staking model has proved to be a more user friendly experience for users, as it allows users can withdraw their staked funds at any time, with little-to-no lock-up period. This is a significant advantage over traditional staking mechanisms, which often require users to lock up their funds for a specified period of time. This however, has led to concerns about centralization, and security of the network.

## Earth Ether

The Earth Ether smart contracts are designed to be fully permissionless similar to RocketPool, with a fair launch of the governance token distributed to early node operators.
For those unfamiliar, this is how it works:

1. **Earth Staked Ether (EARTH) ** deposit/mint ETH for EARTH at a 1:369 ratio at [earthstaking.com/stake](https://earthstaking.com/stake) or [swap ETH for EARTH](https://uniswap.com).
2. **Earth Staking Governance (ESG) Nodes** generate signing keys and post an Regen as collateral for the rights to validated blocks for Earth Ether.

Once 32 ETH is queued in the Earth Ether protocol it is automatically send to a Earth Node to begin generating Ethereum block rewards automatically sent back to the protocol. Every 7 days, the Earth Ether token is rebalanced according to the amount of block rewards generated minus the protocol fees set by the Earthean governance. 
This ensures rewards are distributed to each stakeholders without ever giving Earth Nodes control of the funds, and users are able to unstake their EARTH balance back to ETH by:

1. Withdraw/burn EARTH for ETH at a 369:1 ratio at [earthstaking.com/unstake](https://earthstaking.com/unstake) or [swap EARTH for ETH](https://uniswap.com).
2. If enough liquidity is in the queue, the user can withdraw immediately, otherwise an Earth Node exit signature is submitted to remove an Earth Node from Ethereum validating and return its 32 ETH stake back into the queue.
3. Validator withdrawals [(as of writing)](https://launchpad.ethereum.com/withdrawals) occur roughly every 9 days, after which the funds should be available.

### 1. Stake from a Cold Wallet

Earth Ether was designed from scratch and audited in partnership with Halborn Security to optimize security for large Eartheans. All current staking options require Eartheans
to connect their cold wallet, and earn rewards to that address. Making it necessary for Eartheans to carry their cold wallet with them, or use untruste, gas-inefficient smart contracts for delegating generated staking rewards.

Earth Ether lets you keep your cold wallet at home, and have your rewards paid out to your hot wallet. Giving you the optimal security and user experience for all scenarios.

### 2. Delegate to a Hot Wallet

Earth Ether offers the flexibility to delegate block rewards to a separate wallet, providing optimal security, potential tax benefits, and an enhanced user experience, especially when traveling. 
This feature empowers users to manage their assets and rewards in a manner that best suits their needs while maintaining the highest level of security and control. Deposit the desired amount of Ethereum into Earth Ether's decentralized liquid staking protocol to start earning block rewards.

### 3. Earn Rewards

Your Earth Ether balance will increase every 7 days proportional to the amount of ETH you have staked, and how much the decentralized Earth Node validator network earns over that period.
The current Ethereum staking rewards can be found [here](https://ethereum.com/en/staking/), and can be used as a rough estimate of how much the Earth Node validator network should be earning over time.

Real time analytics will be provided at [earthstaking.com/rewards](https://earthstaking.com/rewards), and will be the sum of the Earth Node validator network minus any fees or network penalties. Any regeneration initiatives
successfully initiated by Earth Wallet will be tracked in real time on the rewards dashboard, to give the community a live update on the status of our pollution cleanup mission.
