## Introduction

Ethereum offers a decentralized approach to digital currency, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and inclusivity. Particularly, its transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) underscores this commitment to a greener, more scalable and egalitarian system. While PoW, with its energy-intensive computations, laid the foundation for Ethereum's establishment, the future ideally leans heavily towards PoS, which not only dramatically reduces the platform's carbon footprint but also democratizes the validation process, allowing more participants to contribute to the network's security. Embracing such a progressive shift, Ethereum can pave the way for a reserve currency that not only facilitates trade but also embodies the ideals of global cooperation and sustainable growth.

## Earth Staked Ether (EARTH)

As an alternative to Lido Staked Ether, which currently poises a security risk to the future of Ethereum. Earth Staked Ether is architected to be fully decentralized, and completely fair launched governance distributed to early stakers and node operators, rather than a small handle of Venture Capitalists and insiders.
Our mission is to create a new global reserve currency leading to a peaceful planet for all life on Earth, not another silicon valley startup that destroys society for personal gain.

### Stake with the Earth

1. Obtain Earth Staked Ether mint ETH for EARTH at a 1:369 ratio with [Earth Staking](https://app.earthstaking.com/stake) or swap ETH for EARTH on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.com).

2. Once 32 ETH is queued in the Earth Staking protocol it is automatically send to a Earth Node to begin generating Ethereum block rewards automatically sent back to the protocol. Every 7 days, the Earth Staked Ether token is rebalanced according to the amount of block rewards generated minus the protocol fees set by the ESG governance. 
This ensures rewards are distributed to each stakeholders without ever giving Earth Nodes control of the funds, and users are able to unstake their EARTH balance back to ETH at any time without ever giving up custody of their assets.

### Stake from your Wallet

Earth Staking was designed from scratch and audited in partnership with Halborn Security to optimize security. To get started, visit our staking app and connect a wallet of your choice (i.e. Earth Wallet).

Earth Staking lets you keep stake from a cold wallet, and have your rewards paid out to a different wallet. Giving you the optimal security and user experience for all scenarios.

### Earn Ethereum Staking Rewards

Your Earth Staking balance will increase every 7 days proportional to the amount of ETH you have staked, and how much the decentralized Earth Node validator network earns over that period.
The current Ethereum staking rewards can be found [here](https://ethereum.com/en/staking/), and can be used as a rough estimate of how much the Earth Node validator network should be earning over time.

Real time analytics will be provided at [earthstaking.com/rewards](https://app.earthstaking.com/rewards), and will be the sum of the Earth Node validator network minus any fees or network penalties. Any regeneration initiatives
successfully initiated by Earth Wallet will be tracked in real time on the rewards dashboard, to give the community a live update on the status of our pollution cleanup mission. 

### Provide Liquidity for additional ESG Rewards (Limited Time)

Earth Staking offers the flexibility to delegate block rewards to a separate wallet, providing optimal security, potential tax benefits, and an enhanced user experience, especially when traveling. 
This feature empowers users to manage their assets and rewards in a manner that best suits their needs while maintaining the highest level of security and control. Deposit the desired amount of Ethereum into Earth Staking's decentralized liquid staking protocol to start earning block rewards.

### Redeeming ETH Rewards

1. Withdraw/burn EARTH for ETH at a 369:1 ratio at [earthstaking.com/unstake](https://earthstaking.com/unstake) or [swap EARTH for ETH](https://uniswap.com).

2. If enough liquidity is in the queue, the user can withdraw immediately, otherwise an Earth Node exit signature is submitted to remove an Earth Node from Ethereum validating and return its 32 ETH stake back into the queue.

3. Validator withdrawals [(as of writing)](https://launchpad.ethereum.com/withdrawals) occur roughly every 9 days, after which the funds should be available.
