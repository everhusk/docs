Earth Staking is built on a foundation of trusted industry partners, leading infrastructure companies, and veterans in the blockchain space. Our mission is to establish a robust and sustainable validator network for EARTH, anchored by the expertise of our Relays, which are our dedicated Node Operators. Relays are crucial in establishing and securing the core network, and are rewarded for this effort.

## Criteria To Become an Earth Staking Relayer
While the typical path to becoming a Relayer is referral from the current layer of Relays, we recognize the value of experienced individuals in this field. Therefore, we offer an alternative route for those who meet our criteria:

1. Experience: Demonstrate at least one year of experience in operating Bitcoin and/or Ethereum nodes.

2. Investment: Commit to staking a minimum of 0.1 BTC or Technology Hardware Equivalent  

3. Commitment: Engage in a minimum of 1-year staking term with a minimum SLA for uptime.

## Eligibility for Non-Referral Applicants
Even without a referral, your expertise in node operation is valuable to us. If you meet the above criteria, we encourage you to apply.
