## Earth Staking Governance (ESG) Nodes

Earth Nodes are the decentralized network of validators who can stake for as little as 3 ETH by helping join our Earth regeneration protocol, anyone can join as a validator by acquiring one (1) [Regen](/governance) and staking as little as 3 ETH as collateral, which is pooled with 29 ETH from the Earth Ether protocol, and used to validate blocks on Ethereum and earn rewards to be used for regeneration initiatives.

*For testnet validators please use this [launchpad](https://testnet.earthstaking.com)*
