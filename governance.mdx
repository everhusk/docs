While still in it's infancy, several attempts to craft what we call 'Regenerative Finance' have been made on the Ethereum blockchain. But many of these attempts have stumbled, because they didn't resonate with enough people, or they didn't mesh seamlessly with existing systems. Earth Staking isn't just another financial tool; it's a magnet pulling in demand and welcoming a fresh group of users, with healthier values into the blockchain ecosystem.

## Earth Staking Governance (ESG) Nodes

Earth Nodes are the decentralized network of validators who can stake for as little as 3 ETH by helping join our Earth regeneration protocol, anyone can join as a validator by acquiring one (1) [Regen](/governance) and staking as little as 3 ETH as collateral, which is pooled with 29 ETH from the Earth Ether protocol, and used to validate blocks on Ethereum and earn rewards to be used for regeneration initiatives.
