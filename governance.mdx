## The Social Dilemma

Today's Social Networks are more powerful than the largest nation states on planet Earth. With Billions of users now being controlled and manipulated by AI algorithms,
operated by private, for-profit corporations, the social fabric of our global society is being destroyed to generate more ad revenue.

This poses a systematic risk to the future of humanity, and life on Earth, which is clearly visible in most western countries, and quickly spreading to any nation that is connected
to the Social Network of the internet. Without a fundamentally new incentive system, and the rising increase of Artificial Intelligence capabilities, the mental health risk to global society
is immense.

## Social Network

Social Network is a new global ledger, built on Bitcoin and Ethereum, for decentralized social networks to support an alternative economy for Earth.

By removing the incentives to grow fiat economies incentivized to fight wars for resources, or corporates incentivized to sell ad revenue for profit, the Social Network
is incentivized to create an alternative economy, rooted in what is best for all life on Earth. Only with new initial incentives will humanity be able to evolve it's current
system, and escape the social dilemma. The Social Network aims to evolve that system.

## Testnet

Earth Staking is a Decentralized, Peer-to-Peer network built ontop of Ethereum and Bitcoin consensus algorithms. This section will overview how to participate 
in running and decentralizing the network, as well as the three phases of network deployment.

## Phase 1) Ethereum Mainnet, Bitcoin Testnet

## Phase 2) Ethereum Mainnet, Bitcoin Mainnet

## Phase 3) Social Network Mainnet (Full Decentralization)

Social Network is a EVM compatible, ZK-rollup network, with data availability on Bitcoin and trustless bridging to the Ethereum blockchain. It achieves this using Taproot scripts to inscribe data into the Bitcoin blockchain, and a decentralized Ethereum validator network to trustlessly bridge the two networks.

Taproot script spends can only be made from existing taproot outputs, thus inscriptions are made with a two-phase commit/reveal scheme. First, in the commit transaction, a taproot output committing to a script containing the inscription content is created.
Second, in the reveal transaction, the output created by the commit transaction is spent, revealing the inscription content on-chain.
But what about the actual data:

“Inscription content is serialized using data pushes within unexecuted conditionals, called an "envelopes". Envelopes consist of an OP_FALSE OP_IF … OP_ENDIF  wrapping any number of data pushes. Because envelopes are effectively no-ops, they do not change the semantics of the script in which they are included, and can be combined with any other locking script.”

## Build the Social Network Testnet

The Social Network is currently live on testnet as a layer 2 rollup, with data availability posted to the Bitcoin testnet. We invite all 
developers, social networking applications, and infrastructure partners to please contact earth@social.network to be eligible for the mainnet distribution.
