## Earth Staking Governance (ESG) Nodes

Earth Nodes are the decentralized network of validators who can stake for as little as 3 ETH by helping join our Earth regeneration protocol, anyone can join as a validator by acquiring one (1) [Regen](/governance) and staking as little as 3 ETH as collateral, which is pooled with 29 ETH from the Earth Ether protocol, and used to validate blocks on Ethereum and earn rewards to be used for regeneration initiatives.

*For testnet validators please use this [launchpad](https://testnet.earthstaking.com)*

## Earth Developers

The easiest way to support our mission is to replace Earth Ether (EARTH) into your smart contract where you can, rather than ETH. This will enable liquidity to grow, and help passively generate more regeneration for the planet.
