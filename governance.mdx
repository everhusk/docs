Decentralization of validator nodes on Ethereum is essential for ensuring the network's security, trustworthiness, and resistance to censorship. If centralized exchanges or single liquid staking protocols amass significant control, they risk compromising the network by becoming prime targets for cyberattacks, manipulating economic incentives, and swaying governance decisions to favor their interests. Such centralization jeopardizes Ethereum's foundational principles, making it imperative to prioritize a distributed validator landscape for the network's longevity and integrity.

## Earth Staking Governance (ESG) Nodes

Earth Nodes are the decentralized network of validators who can stake for as little as 3 ETH by helping join our Earth regeneration protocol, anyone can join as a validator by acquiring one (1) [Regen](/governance) and staking as little as 3 ETH as collateral, which is pooled with 29 ETH from the Earth Ether protocol, and used to validate blocks on Ethereum and earn rewards to be used for regeneration initiatives.
