Bitcoin Social Network (HEART), provides decentralized economic incentives for growing the adoption of decentralized social networks using the Nostr protocol.

The aim of the Bitcoin Social Network is to reduce the sats/byte fees to enable on-chain social networks without burdening everyday Bitcoin node operators, decreating the time to finality to make Bitcoin more acceptable for social media use cases, and removing the high energy demands to satisfy the environmental concerns of Proof-of-Work. This section provides a high level overview of how this can be achieved while maintaining a decentralization.

# Getting Hearts

A user can get Hearts by:

1. Staking their Bitcoin (BTC)
2. Earning it on decentralized social networks by creating valuable content, or
3. Holding it and earning daily Heart rewards

## Staking Bitcoin for Hearts

To begin earning Hearts by staking Bitcoin, create an event_request:

```json
{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": 21,
  "tags": [
    "p": "<pubkey of the bitcoin staking taproot address, as a hex string>",
    "d": "<pubkey of the Social Network EVM address receiving hearts>",
  ],
  "content": <additional data to be stored by relayers>,
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data (same as the id field)>
}
```
Next, create a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT):

```
import earthwallet from 'earth-wallet';
var earth = new earthwallet('yourprivatekey');
var amount = <amount in sats>
var stake_tx = earth.stake_bitcoin(event_request, amount);
// Submit stake_tx to a Bitcoin node
var tx = axios.get(`https://mempool.space/tx/${stake_tx}`);
console.log(`Successfully staked ${amount} sats for hearts! Transaction: https://mempool.space/tx/${tx}`)
```

After 7 confirmations on the Bitcoin network, your heart balance will be updated on the Social Network with `satoshis_staked/total_satoshis_staked * total_heart_supply`, minus any network fees.

## Earning Hearts on Social Networks

Users can additionally earn Hearts by posting valuable content which is saved by others to the Social Network, determined by:

```json
{
  "kind": 22,
  "tags": [
    "e": "event_id of the item being hearted",
    "t": "unix timestamp to heart content until",
    "r": "relayer requested to store the content"
  ],
  "content": "reply or additional note"
  ...
}
```

And submitted to relayers with:
```
import earthwallet from 'earth-wallet';
var earth = new earthwallet('yourprivatekey');
var amount = <amount in heart>;
var heart_tx = earth.heart_event(event_request, amount);
// Submit heart_tx to a Social Network Relayer
var tx = axios.get(`wss://nodes.earthstaking.com/${heart_tx}`);
console.log(`Successfully hearted ${amount}! Transaction: https://mempool.space/tx/${tx}`)
```

If the social network relayer requested approves the content storage request, the event will be set to long term storage by the relayer, heart bonuses will be paid to the and the creator (30%) and relayer (70%), every week at 00:00 Universal Time according to:

Heart_allocated = '(event_data_size / network_capacity) * (unix_timestamp / t) * (2% total_heart_suppy / 52)'

The creation of heart will be set at a maximum of 2% per annum, and allocated to the most important content determined by the Social Network.

## Redeeming Hearts for Bitcoin

To redeem Hearts for Bitcoin, simply call the Heart token contract `unstake(btc_address, amount)` function, with your BTC address, and the amount of Hearts being unstaked back to Bitcoin. Once confirmed on the Ethereum network, the Social Network relayers will transfer the 1/369 satoshis for every Heart unstaked, to the btc_address provided.

# Heart Balances

A users current HEART balance can be verified by making a GET request to https://social.network/.well-known/nostr.json?heart=b0635d6a9851d3aed0cd6c495b282167acf761729078d975fc341b22650b07b9:

```
369369369
```
Heart balances may be considered equal to 369 satoshis (sats) per heart, shown to 8 decimal places.

## About HEART

HEART is a BTC pegged token, representing a share of the liquid staking protocol block rewards, MEV rewards, and more. With HEART, you have the opportunity to earn consistent rewards on your Bitcoin.

## Earn Rewards by Staking Your Bitcoin?!

Yes, you read that correctly. You can now earn rewards by staking your Bitcoin for the first time ever. How does this work? It's made possible through the pegged token, HEART.

## How HEART Rewards Work

Heart Rewards are designed to provide you with a seamless and rewarding experience. When you stake your assets in the Bitcoin Social Network ecosystem, you automatically become eligible to receive a portion of the rewards generated by the protocol. These rewards include not only the standard staking rewards but also the additional benefits that come from activities like MEV (Miner Extractable Value) rewards. 

**How Pegged Tokens Work**

A pegged token maintains a stable value by anchoring itself to a trusted asset, such as USD, ETH, or BTC. The idea behind pegging is to provide stability and predictability to the token's value. 

In the case of HEART being pegged to BTC, it means that the value of one HEART token is designed to be equivalent to a certain amount of BTC. This is achieved by maintaining a specific reserve of BTC and by using smart contracts and algorithms to manage the supply of HEART tokens in a way that keeps their value stable relative to BTC.

## Why Choose HEART Tokens

Earn passive staking rewards on your Bitcoin. Staking also distributes the security of the Bitcoin network through a decentralized network of Earth Nodes.
