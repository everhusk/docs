## What is Earth Staking?
Earth Staking is the world’s first decentralized, and non-custodial Bitcoin staking protocol. Leveraging the cutting-edge Bitcoin Taproot and Ethereum PoS upgrades, Earth Staking is on a mission to revolutionize the crypto space by unlocking ~$1 Trillon in Bitcoin value for a new decentralized and regenerative economy.

But that’s just the beginning. Earth Staking powers the [Social Network](https://social.network), a layer two scaling solution for Bitcoin that is reduces the transaction fee (~1 sats/byte), finality (down to ~1 minute), and energy efficiency of Bitcoin (by ~99.9%).
As an open source, fair launched social network, Earth Staking holds the keys to addressing our planet’s social, economic, and environmental challenges. Join us in decentralizing scaling solutions for Bitcoin, and social networks for Earth.

# How to Join

Earth Staking presents a systemic solution to systemic [problems](/resources/mission), by uniting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Social Networks aligned with regenerating Earth. There is no greater challenge that humanity faces right now than building this new system, and the change starts with you.
