## State of the Earth

For as far as humans can remember there have been wars over resources on Earth. we compete to control, and we grow power to fight in order to control these resources. 
We've created currencies we've invented language, build war machines, all in an effort to battle and control these resources. 
However, in the past 20 years, the ingeniuty of humans has led to the creation of something that has never existed before, the World Wide Web. 
At the speed of light, humans can now communicate, translate, trade, and share with one another, across all borders, languages, divisions, and religions. 
This is never been possible before at global scale, and now we must evolve our current systems in order to evolve our global society. 

## A New Block

Earth staking was created in an attempt to use the uniting potential of the internet, to align humanity with a new path forward which promotes peace and prosperity for all life on Earth. There is no greater challenge that humanity faces right now and building this new system, and we invite you to join by staking for Earth today.

The idea of a neutral currency isn't new. In some ways, gold served as this for many centuriesâ€”a universally accepted medium of exchange and store of value. The rise of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, has reintroduced this idea. Proponents argue that decentralized digital currencies are not tied to any particular nation or government, making them "neutral."

Earth Staking is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that offers the most stable, unifying, and beneficial store of wealth for all life on Earth.
