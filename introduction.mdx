## Background

Planet Earth is home to an estimate ~9 million species of animal life and millions of plant and other organic life. However only one of them, the human species, is increasingly disconnecting itself from the rest.

As the human species pursues its quest for ultimate intelligence through man-made technology, so to has its disconnect with the nature of reality. With the rise of artificial intelligence, this divide may soon become to great to ever return.

Earth Staking aims to bridge this divide, by re-aligning the combined intelligence of the human species to bring us back into harmony with nature, and evolving the purpose of its global social network for a better collective future on Earth.

## The Social Network

Today, the term Social Network is in the memory of humanity as certain a media sharing platform. A centralized platform which is now being used to divide, conquer, and enslave humanity for
shareholder profits. These profits are paid in a currency which was invented to finance war, and increase a value of single nation states, while driving others into choas and ruin.

However it does not need to be this way. Just as humnaity has invented hundreds of sovereign states, thousands of languages, and millions of communities to share a sense of belonging, the Social Network
can also evolve, to bring people together, rather than divide them apart.

We have been led to believe that duality is required form of governance, light/dark, male/female, good/bad, west/east, democrat/republican, and it goes on and on. However, the true nature of reality is non-dualistic, 
it comes from understanding that everything is connected, and we are all integrated in some form or another.

## A New Block

The rise of digital currency, particularly Bitcoin, has for the first time, created a economic system not tied to any particular nation or government, making them politically-neutral, and fixed-supply. Alternative digital currencies like Ethereum, however, have taken a different approach for the infinite garden of human innovation to continue. Both are required
for humanity to evolve, and recognizing the combined potential of both, when integrated, is the key to unlocking the future of a healthy economic system.

Earth staking was created in an attempt to use the uniting potential of the internet, to align humanity with a new path forward which promotes peace and prosperity for all life on Earth. There is no greater challenge that humanity faces right now and building this new system, and we it begins by evolving the dualistic thinking taking shape in the modern economy. 
Decentralized Bitcoin and Ethereum staking protocol that offers the most stable, unifying, and beneficial store of wealth, by integrating the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains to create a new Social Network for Earth.
