## Overview

ESG investing has gained significant attention in recent years as investors increasingly recognize the importance of incorporating sustainability and ethical considerations into their investment decisions. However, it has unfortunately failed to deliver on the promise of creating a new economic framework for avoiding environmental catastrophe. Earth Staking Governance, is bootstrapping a new decentralized ESG framework rooted on the foundational principles of Bitcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum. 

## How it Participate

The protocol will be fair launched on November 11th, 2023, offering the ability for anyone in the world to participate in the fair launch of a new decentralized environmental, social, and governance movement, and help protect all life on Earth. We hope this will ensure a fair distribution of those who are aligned with the right mission.
