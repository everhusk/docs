## What is Earth Staking?
Earth Staking is the world’s first decentralized, and non-custodial Bitcoin staking protocol. Leveraging the cutting-edge Bitcoin Taproot upgrades, Earth Staking is on a mission to revolutionize the crypto space by unlocking over $1 Trillon in decentralized financial market within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

But that’s just the beginning. Earth Staking powers the [Bitcoin Social Network](https://social.network). We believe that social networks hold the key to addressing our planet’s social, economic, and environmental challenges. 

By decentralizing social networks and creating new incentives, we are not only paving the way for a greener Bitcoin through staking but also taking the initial stride in tackling some of the world’s most pressing issues.
