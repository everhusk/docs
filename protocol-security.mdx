## Earth Layers Overview 

Social Network is made up of a decentralized network of Earth Nodes, who together, jointly secure the future of innovation on Bitcoin Taproot & Ethereum Staking for the first time ever. 
This decentralized network is the key to unlocking the potential of the $1T decentralized & regenerative markets on Bitcoin without the systemic risk of centralized exchanges, with significantly less energy, and trust.
Ensuring proper decentralization is critical to the stability and security of the entire purpose of Social Network and the blockchain industry.

Recognizing this significant, the network was fully bootstrapped, with no venture capital or other interests, and initial Taproot Farmer onboarding will be done via a referral system to 
open source and infrastructure providers to both Bitcoin Core and Ethereum Core over the past 7 years. This section will overview the mechanics of the referral system, and how it ensures
simplicity, and maximizes stability, security, and progressively decentralizes as the Taproot Farming network grows in size.

## Scalable Security - Layers of Earth

Protocol Security operates within a structured framework mirroring the Earth's geological layers, encompassing five distinctive tiers: Genesis, Inner Core, Outer Core, Mantle, and Crust. These layers represent crucial milestones in the project's growth and evolution, each unlocking various benefits and features that contribute to the overall Earth Ecosystem.

## Incentives

The primary driving force behind these layers is the amount of assets staked within them. At its inception, Social Network was exclusively focused on staking Bitcoin. As specific thresholds of Bitcoin are staked, corresponding amounts of EARTH Pegged Tokens are minted, marking the progression through Earth's layers:

1. **Inner Core:** ~ 100 BTC staked to the Social Network
2. **Outer Core:** ~ 1,000 BTC staked to the Social Network
3. **Mantle:** ~ 10,000 BTC staked to the Social Network
4. **Crust:** ~ 100,000 BTC staked to the Social Network

Reaching these milestones not only unlocks unique advantages but also signifies the growth and development of the Earth project.

## Earth Layers - Node Operators
The Node system, represented by Node Operators, follows a structured approach with an allocated number of Nodes per layer, each with a specific time commitment:

1. **Inner Core:** 9 Node Operators (4-Year Commitment)
2. **Outer Core:** 90 Node Operators (3-Year Commitment)
3. **Mantle:** 900 Node Operators (2-Year Commitment)
4. **Crust:** 9000 Node Operators (1-Year Commitment)

Within this tiered system, the time commitment for Node Operators decreases as the Earth project progresses. In addition to the time commitment, the HEART Rewards allocated to each Node Operator are determined by the layer and time commitment they are part of. This system is designed to align with Social Network's mission of promoting sustainable growth and fostering a secure infrastructure.

## Mainnet Deployment

The deployment of the Social Network smart contracts to Ethereum was conducted on December 11th, 2023 on Ethereum Block #7124 with txid 0x0 by 0x0, and Bitcoin Block #81249 with txid 0x0 by 0x0.

The Earth Genesis Node enabled the first Bitcoin to be staked to the Social Network. 0x0 has locked the initial BTC deposit for 5 years.

## Earth's Inner Core Nodes

Upon onboarding the next 10 Earth Node Operators, 100 BTC will be eligible for liquid staking on the network, and Earth Nodes will be eligible to invite 10 more node operators to join the
network.

## Earth's Outer Core Nodes

After 100 Earth Nodes have been referred and successfully operating, a total of 1,000 liquid Bitcoin staking will be available for HEART.
At this phase, the Taproot Farming Committee will consist of a 2/3 multisig consisting of Node Zero, Inner Core Nodes, and Outer Core Nodes. If approved,
the referral phase will be disabled, opening public participation in Earth Nodes will be subject to Taproot Farming approval.

## Earth's Mantle Nodes

After 1000 Earth Nodes are successfully operating, the Social Network protocol will enable a maximum of 10,000 of Liquid Bitcoin staking for HEART, and 
begin it's final phase of the journey to the surface of the Earth, where anyone can participate in operating an Earth Node. 

## Earth's Crust Nodes

Once 10,000 Earth Nodes are successfully onboarded and operating, the Social Network protocol will enable a maximum of 100,000 of Liquid Bitcoin staking for HEART. 
At this phase, Social Network governance will be completely controlled by the HEART token distribution which was allocated progressively to Earth Nodes, the Taproot Farming Committee, 
on the Social Network.

## Earth Layers - Community Incentives

The Earth's layered structure serves as a primary incentive mechanism for the Earth community to actively participate in its growth and development. This encompassing community includes various elements such as Bounty Programs, Ambassadors, Research and Development (R&D) initiatives, Campaigns, Grant Programs, Taproot Farmers, and the entire expanding ecosystem. 

As additional security layers of Earth are achieved, [EARTH](/earth) governance allocations will also providing a robust incentive framework to ensure that dedicated contributors are continuously engaged in advancing the Social Network and Social Network ecosystem.

This incentive mechanism is fundamentally aligned with our planet's well-being and improvement. It emphasizes the importance of collective effort and collaboration to enhance and progress Earth for the benefit of all. As the layers expand and evolve, more EARTH tokens are unlocked, ushering in further advancements driven by the decentralized governance of the Social Network. 

This collaborative and incentivized approach is at the core of Social Network's mission to create positive change for our planet.

For The Earth. Governed by the Earth. To Grow The Earth
