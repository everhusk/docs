# Taproot Farmer Applications

The core of Earth Staking is built on top of trusted industry partners, leading infrastructure companies, and veterans in the space. 
By establishing Taproot Farmers with the core infrastructure providers who have helped build Bitcoin and Etheruem, the Social Network
will have a stable foundation to flourish in the future.

Although prospective Taproot Farmers will require a referral from the current layer of Taproot Farmers, if you have demonstratable
experience operating Bitcoin & Ethereum nodes for at least one year, and at a minimum:

1. 0.1111 BTC staked per validator you run
2. 1 year commitment + SLA for uptime
3. Earn $HEART + yield on your staked BTC or ETH
4. Minimum 1 node - Maximum 77 nodes
5. Additional impact rewards available

Please [complete this application](https://earthstaking.typeform.com/to/bM6iXb4c) and we will notify the Farming Committee of your application, 
and someone may reach out if it meets their independant criteria as a Taproot Farming referral candidate. Additionally, we will notify you once
public Farming becomes activated at Layer 4.
