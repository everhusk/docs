# Earth Relayer Applications

The core of Earth Staking is built on top of trusted industry partners, leading infrastructure companies, and veterans in the space. 
By establishing Relays with the core infrastructure providers who have helped build Bitcoin and Etheruem, the Social Network
will have a stable foundation to flourish in the future.

Although prospective Earth Relayers will require a referral from the current layer of EARTH, if you have demonstratable
experience operating Bitcoin & Ethereum nodes for at least one year, and at a minimum:

1. 0.1111 BTC + 1 ETH per Taproot (validator) you plant in your farm
2. 4 year staking commitment + minimum SLA for uptime
3. Earn $HEART + yield on your staked BTC or ETH
4. Additional impact rewards available
5. Minimum 1 - Maximum 77 Taproots

Please [complete this application](https://earthstaking.typeform.com/to/bM6iXb4c) and we will notify the Earth Relayer Committee of your application, and someone may reach out if it meets their independant criteria as a Earth Relayer referral candidate. Additionally, we will notify you once public Farming becomes activated at Layer 4.
