Make sure to store your seed phrase in a safe location, as this will is used to create your unique private key to access your accounts digital assets. If this seed is exposed or lost, it is recommended to move your assets to a new acount.

### Bitcoin Developers

As free open source software, Bitcoin requires open source developers and teams to help maintain, improve, and create new applications.
Earth Wallet is bootstrapped with no VC backing and offers open source tools to build on Bitcoin using Bitcoin Taproot technology and Wallet Connect v2.
This drastically improves the ability for anyone to easily create secure, novel financial applications on Bitcoin with just a few lines of code:

Earth Wallet supports Bitcoin Taproot wallet connections for getting a users Bitcoin Taproot wallet address, triggering a Bitcoin Taproot send or partially signed transaction (PBST), or signing a message with the users selected wallet.
```
const requiredNamespaces = {
  bip122: {
    methods: ["btc_send","btc_signMessage", "btc_signPsbt"],
    chains: ["bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93"],
    events: []
  }
};
```
A sample React application is provided [on the Github repository here](https://github.com/earthstaking/bitcoin-dapp-template), and you can the full Wallet Connect v2 docs [here](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/web3modal/about).
