Decentralization of validator nodes on Ethereum is essential for ensuring the network's security, trustworthiness, and resistance to censorship. If centralized exchanges or single liquid staking protocols amass significant control, they risk compromising the network by becoming prime targets for cyberattacks, manipulating economic incentives, and swaying governance decisions to favor their interests. Such centralization jeopardizes Ethereum's foundational principles, making it imperative to prioritize a distributed validator landscape for the network's longevity and integrity.

## Application Developers

Earth Nodes are the decentralized network of validators who can run nodes on the protocol and decentralize the Earth Staking protocol, to participate you will need to 2 ETH and 5 ETH worth of ESG, which is pooled with 30 ETH from the Earth Staking protocol to validate and earn Ethereum block rewards.

There are two main ways to obtain ESG:

1) Deposit your EARTH token to the seed liquidity pool. Early liquidity providers will earn ESG tokens proportional to the amount of time they provide liquidity, and the amount of liquidity they provide.

2) Purchase ESG on secondary markets.

Once you obtain ESG, visit the [launchpad](https://launch.earthstaking.com), and follow the steps to deploy an Earth Staking Governance Node.

Earth Node operators are essential to the success and decentralization of the network, as such there are several incentives to be a part of the network:

1. Earn ~10% higher Ethereum staking rewards on the 2 ETH provided.
2. Earn ESG benefits as the ecosystem matures and scales its social and governance systems.
