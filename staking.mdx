## Introduction

In our world today, the stability of our global reserve currency is disproportionately anchored to the resource wealth and economic prowess of a select few nations. This dynamic inevitably places the vast majority of our planet's inhabitants in a defensive stance, constantly striving for resource access and, in essence, battling for their very survival. The U.S. dollar’s predominant role in international commerce, especially its ties to oil - aptly termed the “petrodollar” - stands testament to the intricate interplay of economic strategy and political leverage.

Now, as our planet witnesses a surge in its populace and our collective footprint strains the balance of nature, resulting in heightened migration due to erratic weather patterns, agricultural disruptions, and dwindling freshwater sources, we stand at a pivotal juncture. We are presented with two divergent paths: one, a cataclysmic clash over dwindling resources, the likes of which history has never witnessed, and two, an evolution of our monetary system, forging a currency that embodies the ideals of global harmony and collective prosperity.

Ethereum is a politically neutral, global scale economic system, which enables a new global economy to incentivize a means of resource wealth and economic prowess aligned with the solving problems of the 21st century.

## Earth Staked Ether (EARTH)

Earth Staked Ether is architected to be fully decentralized, our mission is to create a new global reserve currency leading to a peaceful planet for all life on Earth, rather than competing with other forms of life on Earth for individual gain.

### Stake with the Earth

1. Obtain Earth Staked Ether mint ETH for EARTH at a 1:369 ratio with [Earth Staking](https://app.earthstaking.com/stake) or swap ETH for EARTH on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.com).

2. Once 32 ETH is queued in the Earth Staking protocol it is automatically send to a Earth Node to begin generating Ethereum block rewards automatically sent back to the protocol. Every 7 days, the Earth Staked Ether token is rebalanced according to the amount of block rewards generated minus the protocol fees set by the ESG governance. 
This ensures rewards are distributed to each stakeholders without ever giving Earth Nodes control of the funds, and users are able to unstake their EARTH balance back to ETH at any time without ever giving up custody of their assets.

### Stake from your Wallet

Earth Staking was designed from scratch and audited in partnership with Halborn Security to optimize security. To get started, visit our staking app and connect a wallet of your choice (i.e. Earth Wallet).

Earth Staking lets you keep stake from a cold wallet, and have your rewards paid out to a different wallet. Giving you the optimal security and user experience for all scenarios.

### Earn Ethereum Staking Rewards

Your Earth Staking balance will increase every 7 days proportional to the amount of ETH you have staked, and how much the decentralized Earth Node validator network earns over that period.
The current Ethereum staking rewards can be found [here](https://ethereum.com/en/staking/), and can be used as a rough estimate of how much the Earth Node validator network should be earning over time.

Real time analytics will be provided at [earthstaking.com/rewards](https://app.earthstaking.com/rewards), and will be the sum of the Earth Node validator network minus any fees or network penalties. Any regeneration initiatives
successfully initiated by Earth Wallet will be tracked in real time on the rewards dashboard, to give the community a live update on the status of our pollution cleanup mission. 

### Provide Liquidity for additional ESG Rewards (Limited Time)

Earth Staking offers the flexibility to delegate block rewards to a separate wallet, providing optimal security, potential tax benefits, and an enhanced user experience, especially when traveling. 
This feature empowers users to manage their assets and rewards in a manner that best suits their needs while maintaining the highest level of security and control. Deposit the desired amount of Ethereum into Earth Staking's decentralized liquid staking protocol to start earning block rewards.

### Redeeming ETH Rewards

1. Withdraw/burn EARTH for ETH at a 369:1 ratio at [earthstaking.com/unstake](https://earthstaking.com/unstake) or [swap EARTH for ETH](https://uniswap.com).

2. If enough liquidity is in the queue, the user can withdraw immediately, otherwise an Earth Node exit signature is submitted to remove an Earth Node from Ethereum validating and return its 32 ETH stake back into the queue.

3. Validator withdrawals [(as of writing)](https://launchpad.ethereum.com/withdrawals) occur roughly every 9 days, after which the funds should be available.
