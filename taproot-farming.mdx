## Introduction

Earth Staking is made up of a decentralized network of Taproot Farmers, who together, jointly secure the future of innovation on Bitcoin Taproot & Ethereum Staking for the first time ever. 
This decentralized network is the key to unlocking the potential of the $1T decentralized & regenerative markets on Bitcoin without the systemic risk of centralized exchanges, with significantly less energy, and trust.
Ensuring proper decentralization is critical to the stability and security of the entire purpose of Earth Staking and the blockchain industry.

Recognizing this significant, the network was fully bootstrapped, with no venture capital or other interests, and initial Taproot Farmer onboarding will be done via a referral system to 
open source and infrastructure providers to both Bitcoin Core and Ethereum Core over the past 7 years. This section will overview the mechanics of the referral system, and how it ensures
simplicity, and maximizes stability, security, and progressively decentralizes as the Taproot Farming network grows in size.

## Mainnet Deployment

The deployment of the Earth Staking smart contracts to Ethereum was conducted on December 11th, 2023 on Ethereum Block #7124 with txid 0x0 by 0x0, and Bitcoin Block #81249 with txid 0x0 by 0x0.

Initial Taproot Farmer RFP was made on the Bitcoin Talk Forum, and with ERC-7777, which have has so far led to the following entities being approved on a first come, first serve basis:

- Earth Ecosystems (Approved)
- Halborn Security (Reviewing)
- BloxRoute (Reviewing)
- Chainsafe Systems (Reviewing)
- Consensys (Reviewing)
- Ethereum Foundation (Contacted)
- Sigma Prime (TBD)
- Nethermind (TBD)
- Bitcoin Foundation (TBD)
- Fireblocks (TBD)

The Genesis Taproot Farm is now live at 0x0, which enables the first 2827 of Liquid Ethereum staking for EARTH. 0x0 has locked their initial BTC & ETH deposits for 5 years.

## Inner Core Farmers

Upon creation of Farms by the next 10 Taproot Farmers, each Farmer will be allocated a maximum of 77 taproot farms, required a deposit per validator of:

- 1 ETH (deposited on the EarthStakingController Ethereum smart contract)
- 0.11 BTC (deposited on the Farming Committee Inner Core Pay-to-Tapscript Bitcoin Taproot address)
- Minimum staking period

Upon successful operation of their farm with the maxmimum number of validators, each Taproot farmer will recieve a 4 year vested HEART allocation and enable the next
wave of 100 Taproot Farmers, and secure scaling of the Taproot Farming committee. A maxixmum of 28270 of Liquid Ethereum staking for EARTH will now be available to Ethereum stakers.

## Outer Core Farmers

After 100 Taproot Farmers have been referred and successfully operating farms, a total of 280270 liquid Ethereum staking will be available for EARTH.
At this phase, the Farming Committee will consist of a 2/3 multisig consisting of Farmer Zero, Inner Core Farmers, and Outer Core Farmers. If approved,
the referral phase will be disabled, opening public participation in Taproot Farming subject to Farming Committe approval.

## Mantle Farmers

After 1000 Farmers are successfully operating, the Earth Staking protocol will enable a maximum of 2,827,000 of Liquid Ethereum staking for EARTH, and 
begin it's final phase of the journey to the surface of the Earth, where anyone can participate in operating a Taproot Farm. 

## Crust Farmers

Once 10,000 Farmers are successfully onboarded and operating farms, the Earth Staking protocol will enable a maximum of 28,270,000 of Liquid Ethereum staking for EARTH,
and effectively self limit itself to 28% of the Ethereum staking supply. This solves a much debated problem for the Ethereum staking community, and safety of the consensus.
At this phase, Earth Staking governance will be completely controlled by the HEART token distribution which was allocated progressively to Taproot Farmers, the Farming Committee, 
and the Social Network.
